# Summary

A multivariate regression model that predicts the Eulerian grid size needed for computational fluid dynamics. 

This repository trains a regression model to predict the maximum fireball radius in heavy-ion collision simulations. For a given set of Bayesian model parameters and impact parameter, we can automatically configure the grid size, we can reduce the grid size and speed up the code

We apply in but these techniques can also be generalized to any computational fluid dynamics problem that uses an Eulerian grid.
