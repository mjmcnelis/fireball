## Summary

A multivariate regression model that optimizes the Eulerian grid volume in computational fluid dynamics. 

This repository trains a Lasso regression model to predict the maximum fireball radius in heavy-ion collision simulations. We incorporated these scripts in the hydrodynamic code [VAH](https://github.com/mjmcnelis/cpu_vah) to automatically configure the grid size for a given impact parameter and Bayesian model parameter set. The optimization scheme provides an additional 1.5x speedup for 2+1d simulations (the algorithm has not yet been tested for 3-D grids).

We worked on this project during the Erdos Institute Data Science Boot Camp in 2020. Our powerpoint presentation video explains how the machine learning algorithm works. We also refer the reader to Sec. 5.2 of the VAH paper

These techniques can also be generalized to any fluid dynamics code that uses an Eulerian grid.

## Data

The training and test data sets were generated by [VAH](https://github.com/mjmcnelis/cpu_vah) (see the manual Sec. 7 for more details). 

You can visualize the training data with the notebook `visualize_train_data.ipynb`.
